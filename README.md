👋 Hi, I’m Zachary Dodge (@dodgez)

👀 I’m interested in many different topics not limited to:
  - Rust (and ecosystem)
  - Haskell (and related category theory)
  - Typescript
  - SQL
  - Linux and Windows Subsystem for Linux
  - Git and Pijul
  - Many more!

🌱 I’m currently learning anything I can get my hands on.  Recently that was Rust, Ansi terminal escape sequences, and basic text editors: https://github.com/dodgez/redit

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development, a Rust/Haskell/Typescript codebase, or anything on my interest list.  I especially like working on things I would use personally like https://github.com/starship/starship.
